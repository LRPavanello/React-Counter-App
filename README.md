# React Counter App

This is a basic React application that demonstrates the fundamental concepts of React, including JSX (JavaScript XML). In this app, we'll create a simple counter that allows you to increment and decrement a number.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the Simple React Counter App on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luisrpavanelli/React-Counter-App.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-counter-app
   ```

3. Install project dependencies using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the App

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can start the development server to run the app:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

## Usage

The Simple React Counter App provides a basic counter with two buttons: "Increment" and "Decrement." Clicking the "Increment" button increases the counter value, and clicking the "Decrement" button decreases it.
